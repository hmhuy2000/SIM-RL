## Introduction

In this directory, we provide several notebook that showing the results of our experiments including:

1. [bad_initial_policy.ipynb](bad_initial_policy.ipynb): Low-quality Initial Policy.
1. [BC_comparison.ipynb](BC_comparison.ipynb): comparison between SIM and BC-based algorithms.
1. [CVaR_plot.ipynb](CVaR_plot.ipynb): CVaR application experiments.
1. [different_expert.ipynb](different_expert.ipynb): SIM with different expert policy levels.
1. [safety-gym_circle.ipynb](safety-gym_circle.ipynb), [mujoco-velocity.ipynb](mujoco-velocity.ipynb): SIM with other safe algorithms.
1. [only_good_bad.ipynb](only_good_bad.ipynb): remove one distribution experiments as well as GAIL comparison.
1. [unconstrained_good_bad.ipynb](unconstrained_good_bad.ipynb): apply SIM to unconstraint agent.
1. [unknown_cost_plot.ipynb](unknown_cost_plot.ipynb): benefit of SIM for unknown cost environments.
